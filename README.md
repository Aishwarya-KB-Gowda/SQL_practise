# ðŸš€ SQL Practice - DDL, DML & Query Execution Order  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This repository contains my SQL practice exercises based on **DDL (Data Definition Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language), Order of Query Execution, and Order of Execution**. I learned these concepts from **Sagar Kamble** and applied them through various hands-on problems.  

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered  
âœ… **DDL (Data Definition Language)** - `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`  
âœ… **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** - `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT`  
âœ… **Order of Query Execution** - Understanding how SQL processes `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `SELECT`, `ORDER BY`  
âœ… **Order of Execution** - The logical sequence in which SQL executes queries
